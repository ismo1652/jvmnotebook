Possible use of browser:


 1) ICEBrowser from ICESoft implements a reasonably functional browser. I haven't used recent versions; older versions had trouble with some CSS. That might not affect you, depending on your application.

 2) JRex is a Swing wrapper for Mozilla's rendering engine. It was recently ported to OS X. It can be difficult to get up + running, but it provides a cross-platform browser component. Since it uses the same engine as Firefox, it will render more pages correctly than most (all?) Java-only solutions.

In the hopes of correcting this, I've compiled a number of examples from my International Criminal Law textbook, which was published in 2010. Most of these are almost verbatim. Make of it what you will... granted, some of these protections are difficult to claim, and the case law is still shaky. But the current debate is not whether the Constitution fully protects non-citizens on US territory; that issue was resolved ages ago. The current debate is actually over the extent to which the Constitution should protect non-citizens abroad who come into contact with the US justice system. \n\nBasically, there is no possible way you can look at the current information and agree that that the Constitution fails to protect non-citizens, especially non-citizens on US territory.\n\n**Habeas corpus protection (from Article I):**\n\n* Foreigners captured abroad and held on foreign territory under de facto US control can proceed with habeas corpus claims in US courts. (Boumediene v. Bush, 2008)\n\n**Fourth Amendment protections:**\n\n* The 4th Amendment applies to \"the people,\" a term that suggests throughout the Constitution a class of persons who are part of the national community or have sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of the community - **this includes resident and possibly non-resident aliens in the US**. (US v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 1990)\n* If foreign officials collect evidence on foreign territory under foreign law and turn it over to US officials for use in US courts, the US courts may exclude the evidence if the circumstances of the foreign search and seizure \"shock the conscience\" (typically anything unreasonable under foreign law). (US v. Barona, 1995)\n* If foreign officials and US officials collaborate to evade constitutional requirements and seize evidence illegally on foreign territory, that evidence may be excluded in US courts. (US v. Maturo, 1992)\n* Evidence illegally seized by foreign officials under foreign law may be excluded in US courts, if US agents substantially participate in the raids. (Stonehill v. US, 1968)\n\n**Fifth Amendment protections (Miranda rights, arising from Miranda v. Arizona):**\n\n* \"It must be concluded that all persons within the territory of the US are entitled to the protection guaranteed by the fifth and sixth amendments\" **regardless of alien status**. (Wong Wing v. US, 1896)\n* Foreign nationals interrogated overseas but tried in US courts are protected by the 5th Amendment's self-incrimination clause. No person tried in US courts can be compelled to be a witness against himself. **The 5th Amendment applies equally to US citizens and foreign nationals present in the US, even those here unlawfully.** Statements elicited during overseas interrogation by foreign police in the absence of Miranda warnings must be suppressed when US law enforcement agents actively participate in the interrogation. (US v. Odeh et al, 2008)\n* Aliens in the US can claim a Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. \"**Resident aliens ... are considered 'persons' and are entitled to the same protections as citizens.**\" (US v. Balsys, 1998)\n\nIt is also worthy to note that the Constitution makes a distinction between \"person\" and \"citizen\" because \"person\" is supposed to apply to all people in the US regardless of citizenship. If the framers intended for \"person\" to mean \"citizens of the US,\" they would not have switched to \"citizen\" rather than \"person\" in the provisions regarding eligibility for the Presidency and so on.\n\nThere are, of course, numerous cases which hold that the Constitution does not protect foreign nationals in non-US territories. However, this is important so I will repeat it again, US courts have consistently held (actually, they just assume this) that the Constitution protects persons on US territory regardless of citizenship status. It is pretty clear that most of these protections are actually limitations on what the government can or can't do; citizenship status is irrelevant.

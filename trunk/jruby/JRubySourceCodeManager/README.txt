The following example illustrates how to use JRuby and the Spring MVC framework. 
It is based on the jobster Ruby and Spring example; the examples in the blog entry 
below didn't work 100% due to missing code and other issues, but the example on 
this page is a working reimplementation. Of course, to get the examples running, 
you will need a working J2EE environment (a servlet container, java, jdk, and a little patience).

"The goals of the project are to permit rapid innovation and iteration, full reuse of our existing Spring and Hibernate business logic and objects, and a smooth transition from prototype to production code."

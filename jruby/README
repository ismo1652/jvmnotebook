 JRuby is a Java implementation of the Ruby interpreter, being developed by the JRuby team.

 JRuby is free software released under a three-way CPL/GPL/LGPL license.

 JRuby is tightly integrated with Java to allow the embedding 
 of the interpreter into any Java application with full two-way 
 access between the Java and the Ruby code. (Compare Jython for the Python language.)

 JRuby's lead developers are 
 Charles Nutter [1], Thomas Enebo [2] Ola Bini [3] and Nick Sieger [4]. 
 In September 2006, Sun Microsystems hired Enebo and Nutter to work on JRuby full time.[1] 
 In June 2007, ThoughtWorks hired Ola Bini to work on Ruby and JRuby.[2]

Text Attributes
---------------


EIRC supports mIRC text attribute codes, plus some extensions. Users should use the textual representation of the control codes (see below) instead of typing those directly; textual codes are easier to remember, and easier to type. Codes are case sensitive.

%A - Bell

%B - Bold

%Cn,m - Color
 N and M specify fore and background text colors respectively, valid values range from 0 to 15. Both values are optional, in case neither is provided, color is restored to defaults.

%I - Italic (EIRC extension)

%O - Reset
 Resets the attributes to regular font and default text colors.

%R - Reverse
 Reverses fore and background colors.

%U - Underline

Bold, Italic and Underline attributes are toggles.

%% - "%"

Prints a singe % character.

%x - "%x"

Prints the string unmodified, where x is any character not listed above.
